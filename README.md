# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

Problem Statement:

The objective of this HR analytics project was to analyze employee attrition patterns and understand the key factors influencing turnover within the organization. The aim was to help HR professionals identify risk areas, such as departments, salary ranges, and age groups with higher attrition rates, enabling them to design better retention strategies and workforce planning initiatives.

What I Did:

1. Data Cleaning: Cleaned and modified the data using power bi's power query.

2. Data Visualization: Created an interactive dashboard showing overall metrics like total employees (1,470), employees who left (237), and overall attrition rate (16.1%).

3. Age Group Analysis: Displayed attrition by age, showing that employees aged 18–25 had the highest turnover at 35.8%, indicating younger employees are more likely to leave early in their careers.

4. Salary Slab Analysis: Analyzed attrition by salary range, revealing that employees earning up to 5K had the highest attrition (21.8%), showing a link between pay and retention.

5. Job Role & Tenure Insights: Visualized attrition by job role and years at the company, showing that sales representatives and employees with less than two years of experience were most likely to leave.

6. Departmental View: Added slicers for departments (HR, R&D, Sales) to compare attrition and salary trends interactively.

Tools Used

Microsoft Power BI: For building an interactive dashboard with KPIs, bar charts, and line graphs.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to calculate metrics like attrition rate and average salary dynamically.

Recommendations

1. Retention Programs for New Hires: Since younger employees (18–25) have the highest attrition, mentorship and career growth programs can improve engagement and retention.

2. Review Compensation Structure: Attrition is highest among employees earning below 5K — revising pay scales or introducing performance incentives can reduce turnover.

3. Sales Department Focus: Sales roles show the highest attrition; introducing rewards, flexible targets, and stress management support could help.

4. Long-Term Engagement: Employees tend to leave early in their tenure — HR should emphasize onboarding experiences and growth opportunities within the first two years.

Conclusion

This HR analytics dashboard provided a clear picture of workforce trends and attrition drivers. The insights revealed that compensation, job role, and age significantly impact employee turnover. By using data-driven insights, the organization can strengthen its employee engagement strategies, reduce attrition, and build a more stable, satisfied workforce. The project also enhanced my understanding of using Power BI for HR decision-making and storytelling through visual data.
